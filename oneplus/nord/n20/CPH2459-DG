this will only work if you have fastboot available to you. if all you have is EDL, then this method will not work.

to get rid of RW and get back into the stock stream, follow these steps.
NOTE: you must also do this if you wish to get out of RW.
WARNING: your slot must be slot A in order for the phone to boot properly
if you get reboots, or it goes into fastboot, check active slot, if slot B, switch to A.

this works for all updates, but must be used from C.13 onwards.
