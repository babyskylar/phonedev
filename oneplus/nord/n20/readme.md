in order for setting the phone up you will need "[files-needed.7z](https://github.com/babyskylar/phonedev/releases/tag/files-needed)"
and they need to be done in this order in order for it to work
1. [bootloader unlock](https://github.com/babyskylar/phonedev/blob/main/oneplus/nord/n20/bl-unlock.md)
2. [root phone](https://github.com/babyskylar/phonedev/releases/tag/GN2200_11_C.12-root)
3. [verity disable](https://github.com/babyskylar/phonedev/releases/tag/GN2200_11_C.12-verity-disabled)
4. [RW](https://github.com/babyskylar/phonedev/releases/tag/GN2200_11_C.12-RW)
5. [gpay fix](https://github.com/babyskylar/phonedev/releases/tag/gpay-fix) (you can do the gpay fix at any time for one of the tuts, if that's all you want.)
